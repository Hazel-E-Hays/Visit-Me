# Visit-Me
Visit Me is a prototype application that seeks to connect families with their loved ones in the hospital. Our goal was to facilitate a higher degree of 
communication for people who were unable to use traditional tools like cellphones or room phones. Visit Me is made of HTML and Javascript. In order to 
view the interactive prototype, pull the repo into a local folder on your computer. Then, open up the HTML file called CoverPage in a standard web browser.
You will be prompted to login, however simply pushing the login button will allow you to begin interacting with the prototype. 

You can begin to use the prototype to explore features like messaging, video calls, calendar, and notes for providers. Visit Me is meant to be a mock up 
prototype for an application and is not intended for actual use.
